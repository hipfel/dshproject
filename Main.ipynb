    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project focuses on the air conditioning of a greenhouse during a hot, humid and sunny summer day while the sun is in the zenith. On one hand, air handling with traditional cooling and dehumidification is considered. On the other hand, dehumidification by absorption with a salt solution is evaluated and compared to the traditional process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays professional greenhouses are highly developed technical facilities. As plants need sunlight for photosynthesis, the concept of installing a glass shell is the only building characteristic that persisted. In a mild climate like switzerland, greenhouses need to be heated for most of the year. For saving heat energy, double glazing has become state of the art in greenhouse construction. However, the better insulated glass increases problems with high humidity and temperature inside the greenhouse during summertime. Because of better heat insulation, water vapor cannot condensate fast enough on the windows to reduce air humidity. In addition, the indoor temperature rises to higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To cope these problems, different techniques can be applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional cooling and dehumidification: Blinds are closed to reduce solar heat gains and windows are opened on the roof to transport humidity out of the greenhouse. This is a cost-effecive way of supporting the HVAC system, which has to compenste for the residual energy needed to cool and dehumidify the supply air during a humid summerday. Unfortunately with the increased air infiltration, heat gains increase too.\n",
    "- Absorption dehumidification: As humidity can be fully controlled under low energy consumption by a salt solution, there is no need for opening windows. This greatly reduces ventilation losses as well as latent heat gains from infiltration air. Some air is still exchanged to control the carbon dioxide levels in the greenhouse. Blinds on the roof are closed to reduce solar heat gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, plants grow optimally with a relative air humidity of 60-70 % and temperatures around 20-28 °C (some exceptions exist). With relative humidity over 85% and temperatures over 32 °C, most plants stop growing ([ki-portal.de](https://www.ki-portal.de/wp-content/uploads/featured_image/9cf64eb0ec2.pdf)).\n",

    "## House description\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigated house is a professional greenhouse in Wangen near the city of Dübendorf. All walls and the ceiling consist of windows that are enclosed in a metal frame. For simplicity, the whole outer building shell is assumed to be glass. During cold periods it is beneficial to lose as less heat as possible, therefore modern professional greenhouses are mostly equipped with double glazig. In this investigation, double glazing is used. As the heat transfer to the ground is negligible in contrast to the transfer trough all glass surfaces, the floor is assumed to be an perfect thermal isolator. The first picture shows the front view. As it can be seen, there are two main doors for entering the greenhouse.\n",

    "The following pictures show the side and top view of the greenhouse. Openable windows are installed on the roof (bold rectangles). On a hot, sunny summerday the temperature in the greenhouse would rise to levels which are hindering plant growth or even damaging them. Therefore, they typically stay open during such times to reduce humidity while simultaneously reducing the cooling load of the HVAC system. For the investigation all marked windows are completely open and provide the desired air change.\n",

    "The following steps describe the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Humid air (from the greenhouse) is fed into a packed column.\n",
    "2. In the packed column humid air gets in contact with a hygroscopic salt solution, which trickles down the column. During contact of both streams, water from the humid air is absorbed into the salt solution and the latter is therefore diluted. The air is dried to a lower humidity than needed in the greenhouse.\n",
    "3. In a last step, the air is humidified again with water sprays. During this step, the feed water evaporates and cools the air down to the desired temperature. The conditioned air is blown into the greenhouse again.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reusability, the diluted salt solution undergoes a regeneration process: The solution is heated to 70 °C, where water evaporates and a concentrated solution is available again. This is a simplified case for the summer dehumidification mode. In general, the outflowing air humidity is controlled by adjusting the salt solution concentration and the temperature can be controlled by adjusting the salt solution temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, this process is compared to cooling wirth dehumidification by calcualting the enthalpy differences for acheiveing the desired air properties with both processes. To calculate the enthalpy for each process point, the \"HAPropsSI\" function of the Python package \"CoolProp\" was used.

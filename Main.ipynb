    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the air conditioning of a greenhouse during a hot, humid, and sunny summer day while the sun is in the zenith. On one hand, air handling with traditional cooling and dehumidification is considered. On the other hand, dehumidification by absorption with a salt solution is evaluated and compared to the traditional process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, professional greenhouses are highly developed technical facilities. As plants need sunlight for photosynthesis, the concept of installing a glass shell is the only building characteristic that persisted. In a mild climate like in Switzerland, greenhouses need to be heated for most of the year. In order to save heat energy, double glazing has become state of the art in greenhouse construction. However, the better insulated glass increases problems with high humidity and temperature inside the greenhouse during summer. Because of better heat insulation, water vapor cannot condensate fast enough on the windows to reduce air humidity. In addition, the indoor temperature rises to higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To cope with these problems, different techniques can be applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traditional cooling and dehumidification:** Blinds are closed to reduce solar heat gains. This is a cost-effecive way of supporting the HVAC system. Dehumidification is achieved by cooling the air and reheating to the desired supply air temperature.\n",
    "- **Absorption dehumidification:** Humidity can be fully controlled under low energy consumption by a hygroscopic salt solution. The desired indoor temperature is achieved using adiabatic humidification. Blinds are closed to reduce solar heat gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, plants grow optimally with a relative air humidity of 60-70 % and temperatures around 20-28 °C (some exceptions exist). With relative humidity over 85 % and temperatures over 32 °C, most plants stop growing \\[3\\].\n",

    "The investigated building is a professional greenhouse in Wangen near the city of Dübendorf. All walls and the ceiling consist of windows that are enclosed in a metal frame. For simplicity, the whole outer building shell is assumed to be glass. During cold periods it is beneficial to lose as little heat as possible. Therefore, modern professional greenhouses are mostly equipped with double glazing. In this investigation, double glazing is used. As the heat transfer to the ground is negligible in contrast to the transfer trough all glass surfaces, the floor is assumed to be a perfect thermal isolator. The first picture shows the front view.\n",

    "1. Humid air (from the greenhouse) is fed into a packed column.\n",
    "2. In the packed column humid air gets in contact with a hygroscopic salt solution, which trickles down the column. During contact of both streams, water from the humid air is absorbed into the salt solution and the latter is therefore diluted. The air is dried to a lower humidity than needed in the greenhouse.\n",
    "3. In a last step, the air is humidified again with water sprays. During this step, the feed water evaporates and cools the air down to the desired temperature. The conditioned air is blown into the greenhouse again.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reusability, the diluted salt solution undergoes a regeneration process: The solution is heated to 70 °C, where water evaporates and a concentrated solution is available again. In general, the outflowing air humidity is controlled by adjusting the salt solution concentration and the temperature can be controlled by adjusting the salt solution temperature.\n",

    "In this chapter, this process is compared to cooling with dehumidification by calcualting the enthalpy differences for acheiveing the desired air properties with both processes. To calculate the enthalpy for each process point, the \"HAPropsSI\" function of the Python package \"CoolProp\" was used.

    "# Conclusion and outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "Model results for cooling with dehumidification are plausible and the air change rate as well as the outdoor mass flow are in agreement with values from \\[3\\]. The comparison of absorption dehumidification to dehumidification by cooling and then reheating gives an insight of the advantages of absorption dehumidification. Purely by application of other, less energy demanding sub-processes, lots of energy can be saved. This investigation shows, that roughly 30 % energy savings (example conditions) can be achieved. These findings are in agreement to the \"D2.5, Demonstrator Results\" report of the EU Horizon 2020 Project \"H-DisNet\" ([Reports of Project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/695780/results)). Danesi et al. even measured energy savings of 51 and 58 % during heating operation in a test facility ([Danesi et al.](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5d097c5f6&appId=PPGMS)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes on this investigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The comparison is done by calculating enthalpy differences and projecting the savings onto the model results of cooling with dehumidification. For more precise results, the absorption process could also be modelled or measuring data for both processes can be collected.\n",
    "2. The heat needed for regenerating the salt solution of the absorption process is roughly equal to the latent heat load taken out of the humid air. As the regeneration takes place at around 70 °C, the required heat can be delivered by a heat pump, further reducing energy consumption by a factor of 3. Furthermore, the regeneration can be done by waste heat, eg. from waste incineration plants or industrial processes.\n",
    "3. In dehumidification by cooling the dehumidification performance is limited by the cooling capacity of the refrigeration machine. In contrast, the dehumidification performance in the absorption process can be scaled arbitrarily by increasing the volume flow of the salt solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future investigations, the following work is proposed:\n",
    "- Designing a model for the absorption process with salt solution regeneration\n",
    "- Compare the results of the existing \"cooling with dehumidification\" model with the new \"absorption process\" model\n",
    "- Validation of the models with measurement data\n",
    "- Applying the investigation on a real greenhouse, thus taking values of the real building for calculating the building loads"

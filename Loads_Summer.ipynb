    "# Overview\n",
    "This Project focuses on the air conditioning of a greenhouse during a hot, sunny summer day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays professional greenhouses are highly developed technical facilities. As plants need sunlight to grow, the concept of installing a glass shell is the only building part that persisted. In a mild climate like switzerland, greenhouses need to be heated for most of the year. Therefore, for saving heat energy, double glazing has become state of the art in greenhouse construction. However, the better insulated glass increases problems of high humidity inside the greenhouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally plants grow optimally with a relative air humidity of 60-70 %\n",
    "With better heat insulation trough double glazing, water vapor in the air can't condensate enough on the windows.\n",

    "# Calculating thermal loads for summer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characterization of the building\n",
    "\n",
    "The loads are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sensible: $Q_s = UA(\\theta_0 - \\theta_i) + {\\dot{m}}_{inf}c(\\theta_0 - \\theta_i) + \\dot{Q}_{s,aux}$\n",
    "- latent: $Q_l = {\\dot{m}}_{inf}l(w_0 - w_i) + \\dot{Q}_{l,aux}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ The global conductivity through thermal bridges ($\\psi l$) are neglected as the greenhouse is not insulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information needed for modeling is:\n",
    "- $UA$ global conductivity through the walls [W/K]\n",
    "- ${\\dot{m}}_{inf}$ mass flow of infiltration air [kg/s]\n",
    "- $\\dot{Q}_{s,aux}$ sensible auxiliar heat gains (from sun, occupants, electrical devices, etc.) [W]\n",
    "- $\\dot{Q}_{l,aux}$ latent auxiliar heat gains (from occupants, evaporative processes from plants, etc.) [W]\n",
    "\n",
    "## House description\n",
    "The investigated house is a professional greenhouse in Wangen near the city of Dübendorf. All walls and the ceiling consist of windows that are enclosed in a metal frame. For simplicity, the whole outer building shell is assumed to be glass. During cold periods it is beneficial to lose as less heat as possible, therefore modern professional greenhouses are mostly equipped with double glazig. In this investigation, double glazing is used. The ceiling panes are facing to the east resp. west. On the inside there is a concrete floor on which plant tables with the grown plants are located. As the heat transfer tot he ground is negligible in contrast to the transfer trough all glass surfaces, it is assumed to be an ideal thermal isolator. The first picture shows the front view. As it can be seen, there are two main doors for entering the greenhouse.\n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "The following pictures show the side and top view of the greenhouse. Openable windows are installed on the roof (bold rectangles). On a hot, sunny summerday the temperature in the greenhouse would rise to levels which are hindering plant growth or even damaging the plants. Therefore they typically stay open during such times to reduce temperature while simultaineously reducing the cooling load of the HVAC system. For the investigation all marked windows are assumed to be completely open.\n",

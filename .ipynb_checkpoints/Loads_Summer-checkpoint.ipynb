    "## House description\n",
    "The investigated house is a professional greenhouse in Wangen near the city of Dübendorf. All walls and the ceiling consist of windows that are enclosed in a metal frame. For simplicity, the whole outer building shell is assumed to be glass. During cold periods it is beneficial to lose as less heat as possible, therefore modern professional greenhouses are mostly equipped with double glazig. In this investigation, double glazing is used. On the inside there is a concrete floor on which plant tables with the grown plants are located. As the heat transfer tot he ground is negligible in contrast to the transfer trough all glass surfaces, it is assumed to be an ideal thermal isolator. The first picture shows the front view. As it can be seen, there are two main doors for entering the greenhouse.\n",

    "The following pictures show the side and top view of the greenhouse. Openable windows are installed on the roof (bold rectangles). On a hot, sunny summerday the temperature in the greenhouse would rise to levels which are hindering plant growth or even damaging the plants. Therefore they typically stay open during such times to reduce temperature while simultaineously reducing the cooling load of the HVAC system. For the investigation all marked windows are assumed to be completely open.\n",
